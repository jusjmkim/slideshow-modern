## Intro
A clean, modern Slide Show (S9) template pack that lets you use wiki-style
markup languages like Markdown and Textile to generate an HTML slideshow.

## Try It Yourself - How To Use The Modern Template Pack
If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the
command:<br \>
`$ slideshow install modern`

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using git. Issue the commands:<br \>
`$ cd ~/.slideshow/templates`<br \>
`$ git clone git://github.com/slideshow-s9/slideshow-modern.git`

To check if the new template got installed, use the list command:
`$ slideshow list`

Listing something like:<br \>
`Installed templates include:`<br \>
`modern.txt (~/.slideshow/templates/modern/modern.txt)`

Now you're ready to use it using the -t/--template switch. Example:<br \>
`$ slideshow build tutorial -t modern`

That's it.
